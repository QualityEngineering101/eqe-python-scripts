# EQE-PYTHON-SCRIPTS

## Project Details

This project provides examples of using python with existing packages to accelerate learning or implementation of automation scripts by quality engineers, automation engineers, or quality assurance analysts.

### Sub Directories

* [selenium](https://github.com/QualityEngineering101/eqe-python-scripts/tree/main/selenium) - scripts created using selenium
* [behave](https://github.com/QualityEngineering101/eqe-python-scripts/tree/main/behave) - scripts created using the behave package (BDD) with selenium
* [sqlite3](https://github.com/QualityEngineering101/eqe-python-scripts/tree/main/sqlite3) - scripts created using the sqlite3 db package with selenium
* (coming soon) playwright - scripts created using playwright


This repository showcases practical, real-world Python automation examples for Quality Engineers, spanning UI testing, BDD frameworks, API validation, database operations, and DevOps integration.

## Feature List

Each feature area is now documented in its own dedicated markdown file:

- [Selenium Examples](./selenium_examples.md) – Browser automation using Selenium WebDriver
- [Behave Examples](./behave_examples.md) – BDD-style testing with `.feature` files and step definitions
- [BDD Step Auto Generation](./bdd_step_autogen.md) – Auto-generating Python step implementations from feature files
- [Sqlite3 Examples](./sqlite3_examples.md) – Lightweight database validation and baseline compare testing
- [FastAPI: API + CI/CD Automation](./fastapi_examples.md) – Build, test, and deploy modern APIs with GitHub Actions and Docker
